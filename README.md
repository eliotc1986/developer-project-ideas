# Developer project ideas 

A list of small project ideas for learning and practicing key development skills. Build these in any order and customize them to your heart's content.

### Tips for success

- Use a tool like [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) or [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) and create a new sandbox or pen for each project
- When you are done, share a link with a programming friend and get feedback on your code
- After meeting the basic requirements, add some additional features or try to customize the design

Build a simple guest counter that will keep track of how many adults, children and infants are in the group.

### Requirements

1. When the user clicks on the plus button, the count for that item will increase
1. The total count of guest will also increase
1. When the user clicks on the minus button, the opposite will happen.
1. Add a min count, so that the guest count can't go below 0.

### Ideas for expansion

- Add a optional max guest count
- Style the focus, hover, active and disabled states for the buttons
- Animate the user interactions
